# Instructions to run the code (How to Run the Code):

To replicate the experiments' results:

- The implementation of MLP used for Deep learning assignment 1 at the University of Sydney adopted the base code provided in the DL tutorial. We extend the implementation to meet the criteria specified by the assessment.

- We present a runnable Jupyter notebook in the above link for submission and demonstration purposes. We used the python files to run the experiment on the local machine, the results are provided in the report.

- To run the notebook, make sure that you run the code block sequentially, this is a crucial step you have to follow!
- To run the codes, navigate through the path "python ./merge_version/version1.0/train.py". If you want to replicate the experiment results, please navigate into the foders of "xxxx_powrshell_script" and run the related .ps1 files in terminal in **window system**. 

**Note that you might be asked to log in to a google account to gain permission to download the data files. If so, please do not hesitate to do so. Otherwise, the notebook can not be executed successfully.**
